Why Async is Needed in JS:
        The JS is single-thread ----> It can only excecute one operation at one time
        without the async operation, some task take much time then expected, it blocks the main thread
            making the application unresponsive.
        Also with the Async program ---> JS can handle this kind of task without freezing it
        It makes the Async is efficient.
